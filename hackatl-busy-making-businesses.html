<span style="font-weight: 400">Hello Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It’s been a <strong>busy</strong> couple of weeks for PantherHackers! This past weekend, from November 4th - November 6th, we had <strong>two</strong> hackathons with PH representing: HackATL and UGAHacks! While John Choi covered UGAHacks in a post, which you can check out <a href="http://pantherhackers.com/ugahacks-party-school-turned-hacker-school/">here</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> PantherHacker members definitely raised the bar at at HackATL with these projects: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Team Members: Darien Pourmehr, Nick Wan, Alma Gonzalez, Haroon Qahtan, Riyan Imam</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This project </span><span style="font-weight: 400">is a location-based marketing application that allows students with verified credentials to be able to have the quickest access to promotional deals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Stor:</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Team Members: Yassin Alsahlani, Darran Tavin Hall, Snotti Prince St. Cyr</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This project is like Craigslist, except we have it delivered by our in-house workers. You buy an item off the app (listings are local) and have it delivered. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Give these guys a slap on the back if you see them around campus or DM them on Slack and congratulate them on their work at HackATL!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">That’s all for now guys. As always, <em>stay hungry</em>!</span>
