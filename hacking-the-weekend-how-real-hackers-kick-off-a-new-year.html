<span style="font-weight: 400">Hello Hacker, Hustlers, and Hipsters!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Just over a couple of weekends ago, we had a slew of events that occurred: Global Game Jam, SwampHacks, and PennApps! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Global Game Jam, held at Aderhold Learning Center, is an event where, like a hackathon, people create a project in order to gain the judge’s appeal. However, the difference here is that the participants make a game! We had many great submissions, but only two made the top cut.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, we wouldn’t have a weekend of a bunch of events without a PH win! Our own Viraj Shah and Josh King attended a hackathon for 24 hours (thanks to Luis for that!) and took home the grand prize! A big round of applause for them! Made us proud guys!</span>
